Different components:
Actor core
Planner core
Planner high-level
data structures
test scripts (TO FIX)
domain 
setup = domain + actor + planner + env 
problem = setup + initial state + tasks + events
A test case is an instance of a problem
Each test case is run several times

RAE's communication queues : task queue, command execution queue, command status queue, is a part of the actor object
Duration should move into the domain/env file
exit for the queue
test scripts running
Make every domain compatible with the new refactoring

TOD0
Integration with learning with the new refactoring
Adding method online

Todo in future:
Move/get rid of declare task and declare commands and methods in domain files
Execution Platform
merge the queues and test files - Postponed now for speed to run batch tests; keeps the execution and planning environment models different.

March 29, 2021:
Planner scripts parameters are:
1) RAEPlan: b,k
2) UPOM: nro, d
3) heuristic: None, domainSpecific, learnH

Add some time and date information on the scripts

Verify iterative deepening works alright
write a script to generate data and learn from models
heuristic and Learning for the AIRS domain
