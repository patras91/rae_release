Different components:
Actor core
Planner core
Planner high-level
data structures
test scripts TOFIX
domain 
setup = domain + actor + planner + env 
A problem is setup plus initial state + tasks
A test case is an instance of a problem
A test case is run several times

RAE's communication queues : task queue, command execution queue, command status queue, is a part of the actor object
Duration should move into the domain/env file

test scripts running


Todo in future:
Move/get rid of declare task and declare commands and methods in domain files
relative naming of the paths
Execution Platform
merge the queues and test files
