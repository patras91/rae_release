Different components:
Actor core
Planner core
Planner high-level
data structures
test scripts (TO FIX)
domain 
setup = domain + actor + planner + env 
problem = setup + initial state + tasks + events
A test case is an instance of a problem
Each test case is run several times

RAE's communication queues : task queue, command execution queue, command status queue, is a part of the actor object
Duration should move into the domain/env file
exit for the queue

TODO: Make every domain compatible with the new refactoring

TODO: Integration with learning with the new refactoring
TODO: Adding method online

TODO: Interface with Execution Platform
merge the queues and test files - Postponed now for speed to run batch tests; keeps the execution and planning environment models different.

Planner scripts parameters are:
1) RAEPlan: b,k
2) UPOM: nro, d
3) heuristic: None, domainSpecific, learnH

TODO: Add some time and date information on the scripts

TODO: Verify iterative deepening works alright
TODO: write a script to generate data and learn from models
TODO: heuristic and Learning for the AIRS domain
